        Interaction Framework Theory
    </h1>

<div class="disclaimer-box">
    <h2>Interaction Framework is a modern theory with historical roots. 📢</h2>
    <p> These links can be traced back to behavorism (insert link), etc, and etc. </p>

        This framework is centered around interaction as being necessary for real language learning. Concepts of this framework include (but are not limited to): noticing, modified output, negotiation for meaning, and corrective feedback.

<div class="disclaimer-box">
    <h2>What is 'corrective feedback'? 📢</h2>
    <p> Corrective feedback is an indication to a learner that an error has occurred, with the aim to revise an interlanguage to a target, modified form. </p>
</div>
<div class="disclaimer-box">
    <p>
        In instructional practice, interactionist approaches to teaching can be seen in task-based-language-teaching (TBLT), with a focus on producing target forms in output with relevant vocabulary. In a broader context, there are five main categories of corrective feedback that one may encounter in their acquisition efforts.

    <h2>Along with different types of feedback, there are multiple types of output as well. Here are some specific categories and examples:</h2>
    <ul>
                        <li> Pushed output → practicing recall for weaker vocab (stimulated recall)
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        For example, a researcher/learner/teacher watches a video to understand and reflect upon mistakes made
                                    </li>
                                    </ul>
                        <li> Modified output → learner is prompted through feedback to modify output to target form
                        <li> Unmodified output → uninterrupted dialogue, no feedback, at most clarify learners’ intended meaning
                        </li>
                    </ul>

    <h2>One way age impacts acquistion: 📢</h2>
    <p> As most SLA theories do, the interaction framework functions differently in developmental contexts than it does for second language learning. Individual, environmental, and maturational constraints that adults must face do not impact children’s success in the same way. Their process does not require the same multitude and diversity of feedback. Along with not requiring significant error correction, children’s order of language acquisition often occurs at a consistent sequence and similar timelines. This can be seen in the more rigid timeline for babbling and sound production with infants. For adults, however, tailored, intentional feedback is required– and even then, output results may vary. </p>

        Sociocultural Theory

        Lev Vygotsky was a Russian Psychologist who developed the core of sociocultural theory: the zone of proximal development – or, what one can output with help from others.

    <p> The zone of proximal development (ZPD) is where learning is happening. Sociocultural theory is inherently social, so a blend between comfort and a need to be pushed past one’s comfort zone is ideal for second language acquisition.

    <h2>Comparing and contrasting theories: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> This theory can be contrasted with Krashen’s i + 1 <a href="innatism.html">hypothesis</a>, as the ZPD is collaborative, and his i + 1 is more based on an individual’s comprehension.
            <li> With <a href="interaction-framework.html">interaction theory</a>, one can compare the theory’s emphasis on individuals facilitating their own cognitive processes with the sociocultural focus on the communication itself.
                <ul>
                    <li> Sociocultural: modified input info gathered from external communication and moves to internalization processes
                        <li> Interaction: target language forms are solidified from one’s own produced modified output, not necessarily the type of feedback itself
                    </li>
                </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p> As opposed to other theories, both communication and internal processing are very interconnected and necessary for acquisition, especially considering the effects of the <a href="generalinfo.html">affective filter</a> and the ZPD.

  Sociocultural Theory (SCT) describes SLA as cognitively relational (requiring collaborative effort), L1 mediated (requires some use of the L1), and heavily goal/motivation-driven. SCT is initially intermental (dependent on cognition occurring between two people), and then turns intramental (individual cognition and <a href="HOT.html">automatization</a>), so variation in social skill may indicate different learning outcomes.

    In practice SCT places a strong emphasis on concept-based instruction: meaning students learn what would be socially or professionally useful to them. The role of the instructor holds weight as well– interactions should be meaningful and positive between both parties. To clarify however, communication does not need to occur between a student and teacher, or a pair with a large gap in L2 knowledge, but can occur between two students at a similar level as effectively.

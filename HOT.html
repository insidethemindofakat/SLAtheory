        The Hierarchy and Different Categories of SLA theories:
    </h1>

<div class="disclaimer-box">
    <h2> Formal approaches: üì¢</h2>
    <p> <a href="behaviorism.html"> Universal Grammar </a>, <a href="innatism.html"> Monitor Hypothesis </a>, typological, behaviorist </p>
</div>

<div class="disclaimer-box">
    <h2> Meaning-based approaches: üì¢</h2>
    <p> Functional/lexical approaches, concept-oriented </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Language meaning, not form, is the focus ‚Äì from both form-to-function and function-to-form, learners draw patterns of form-functions from discourse input
            <li> For example, a L1 English student learning French may recognize that in order to convey conditionality or politeness, the conditional mood and subsequent verb conjugations are necessary.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="disclaimer-box">
    <h2> Usage-based approaches: üì¢</h2>
    <p> Construction Grammar (CG), implicit inductive process, statistical </p>
    <ul>
        <li> CG, for example, views specific constructions as having certain impacts on communication output. Compared to usage-based approaches, meaning-based approaches rely on the conceptual ideas, compared to focusing on specific patterns and constructions as in this theoretical framework.
            <li> Computational linguists often ascribe to these theories, as the data collection process tends to be more empirical and statistical.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Sociocultural approaches: üì¢</h2>

                Skill Acquisition Theory:
            </h3>
            <br>
        <strong>Skill Acquisition Theory</strong>, which describes the neurobiological process of automatization, states that language cognition and comprehension can be learned like any other skill.
        <h1> Wait, what is automatization? ü§î </h1>
        <p>
            Automatization is the solidifying of linguistic knowledge through repeated output. After practicing similar/identical vocabulary or constructions multiple times, our brain is better able to recall accurate forms and their corresponding functions.
        </p>
        <br>
            <p>
                This concept can be seen in the Declarative/Procedural model which linguists refer to in acquisition settings. This model is based on data from neurobiology (such as EEG scans to measure electrical brain activity while performing linguistic tasks)
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: left;"> ‚Üí <em> Declarative knowledge (comes with practice) ‚Äì instructed use, explicit <a href="interaction-framework.html">metalinguistic </a> instruction, better suited for older ages </em> </p>
                <p style="text-align: left;"> ‚Üí <em> Procedural knowledge (comes with automatization) ‚Äì naturalistic, immersive use, better suited for younger ages </em> </p>

                Processability theory:
            </h3>
            <p>
                Dr. Manfred Pienemann proposed his Processability Theory as a subsection of the Interaction Framework.

            <p>
                In this theory, learners are constrained by developmental sequences determined on individual cognitive abilities/prior knowledge. For example, learners need to have a certain capacity in their L2 in order to access their L1 <a href="generalinfo.html">transfer</a> of features, as they at least need to be able to ask ‚Äúhow do I say ___?‚Äù in their L2.

            </h3>
        <p> <strong>Cognitive-interactionist thinking borrows from innatism, interactionism, and sociolinguistics. </strong> </p>
            <p>
                In this framework, the following requirements are necessary for second language acquisition.

            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li> Input = lang learners are exposed to examples of output through environment <a href="innatism.html"> (Krashen) </a>
                <li> Comprehensible input <a href="innatism.html"> (i + 1) </a> (aka natural learning)
                <li> Modified output: Native speakers modify language when talking to a percieved language learner
                <li> Modified input: The internal pre-modification of a speaker's output ‚Äì most are interactionally-based and at the current level of the learner
                <li> <a href="interaction-framework.html"> Interaction</a>, negotiation of meaning

        Behaviorism and the Contrastive Analysis Hypothesis

    <p> These theories have largely been disproven in a linguistic setting, however, it still holds accurate in a broader psychological context. </p>

    Behaviorism
</header>
<div class="disclaimer-box">
<p>As it is necessary for a learner to acquire a spoken component of their language, and not always required/possible to learn a written aspect, Behaviorists argue that emphasis of linguistic studies should remain primarily based in oral communication. Following this pattern, children gain speaking abilities long before their writing skills by mimicking the adults around them. Interaction occurs between parents and children, where a stimulus becomes associated with a response or outcome. (Gass 2020) Habit formation occurs when a child repeats phrases, structures, and vocabulary to a point of memorization. These concepts can be traced back to Ivan Pavlov‚Äôs theory of conditioning, where certain stimuli elicit specific responses. Pavlov conducted his classic conditioning experiment by ringing a bell right before feeding a dog, every single meal. After some time, whenever the dog would hear the ding, his mouth would salivate even before the food would appear. This proved that animals, and humans by extension, create associations between input and expected output.<p/>

  Spearheaded by B.F. Skinner's and Pavlov's experiments, linguists used to cite Behaviorism as the leading SLA theory.
</h3>
<div class="disclaimer-box">

    Similar results were reached by B.F. Skinner in his experiment with a conditioning-reward system created for rats. From a linguistics perspective, if a child puts their hands under running water, and a parent repeats ‚Äúwater,‚Äù behaviorists explain that a child will learn how to refer to water in the future if they so wish to. Similarly, and more explicitly, if the child has a request such as ‚ÄúFood?‚Äù or ‚Äúhungry,‚Äù they will be rewarded with their intended outcome when they properly communicate themselves.

    Transfer exists as a very important concept to behaviorism, in all kinds of learning past that of just language acquisition (Gass 2020). As a reminder, linguistic transfer describes the phenomenon of past learning methods impacting how future learning will take place, so behaviorists believe that errors made in L1 learning will likely be made in L2 acquisition as well.

    ‚ÄúL2 learning was seen as the development of a new set of habits,‚Äù (Gass 2020) due to the heavy dominance of Behaviorist theories in mostly all psychological subfields in the 1950s. Although mostly disproven in a linguistic context, Behaviorism aligned with the dominant psychological theoretical framework at the time (Gass 2020), and served as a launching point for many SLA concepts, with the most direct influence on the Contrastive Analysis Hypothesis.

    Contrastive Analysis Hypothesis
</header>

<div class="disclaimer-box">
<p>
    Contrastive Analysis hypothesis is defined as the systematic study of languages in order to identify similarities and differences and potential expected errors. (Montee 2024, Gass 2020)
</p>

    An important central concept to this approach is Lado‚Äôs Hypothesis, which claims that second language learning difficulties will all be due to differences between the first language and target language. (Montee 2024) <a href="generalinfo.html">Transfer</a> will be responsible for the majority of both errors and successes. An example of a beneficial transfer would be a rate advantage, meaning that learning a language occurs faster if the L1 and L2 are more similar.</p>

<div class="disclaimer-box">
<p>
üì¢Example:  In contrast to the benefits of rate advantage, some language learners struggle with imposing their L1 grammar rules onto their L2 output. While native English speakers normally made mistakes with verb-pronoun order, native French speakers do not. (Gass 2020, Zobl 1980)
</p>
    <ul>
        <li> ‚ÄúJe les vois‚Äù (correct French form, Pronoun-Verb) ‚Üí*‚ÄúI them see‚Äù (not a common error for L1 French)
            <li> I see them (correct English form, Verb-Pronoun)‚Üí *‚ÄúJe vois les‚Äù (is a common error for L1 English)
        </li>
    </ul>

<div class="disclaimer-box">
<p>
    The CAH, and therefore Behaviorism, influenced and led to error analysis, a still-utilized, yet sometimes criticized, acquisition tool for determining how to proceed with better learning a language. Researchers have found success in attributing errors in a target language (TL) to differences with the L1, and likewise studying  <a href="generalinfo.html"> interlanguage </a> forms. (Gass 2020) However, it is important to note that error analysis doesn‚Äôt account for ALL errors‚Äì some mistakes are just mistakes.
</p>
    </div>
<img src="contrast2.jpg" alt="C1" class="side-imageL">
<div class="disclaimer-box">
    Although influential, the CAH eventually was proven wrong by the Speech Learning Model from James Emil Fledge, and the Perceptual Assimilation Model from CT Best, both created in 1995. They claim that different <a href="innatism.html">modules</a> are formed for new types of sounds for language learners, and when sounds are very similar, it may be hard for learners to create new subsections and differentiate sounds in their target language.

üì¢What do we know now that behaviorists and CAH followers didn't?
</p>
    <ul>
        <li> L1 is important but not entirely deterministic, as we now know that there are universal developmental stages
            <li> L1 and TL influence each other bi-directionally
            <li> Reverse transfer is common
            <li> Language can affect concepts and how we structure our thoughts‚Äì linguistic relativity hypothesis (Montee 2024) For example, some languages use left and right for directions (egocentric coordinates), while some use North, South, East, and West (cardinal directions). This could impact one‚Äôs ability to conceptualize new vocabulary and other communication tools.
            <li> Language acquisition is not imitation, or pure habit formation (Gass 2020)
            <li> Very difficult to compare just two languages ‚Äì very nuanced, and inaccurate to dichotomize errors with just right or wrong, as seen in the complexity of transfer (Gass 2020)
